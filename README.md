A set of preconfigured rules for PHIVE (Philip Helger Integrative Validation Engine) - pronounced `[ˈfaɪv]`.

This project is part of my Peppol solution stack. See https://github.com/phax/peppol for other components and libraries in that area.

All projects found in here rely on the PHIVE validation engine provided by https://github.com/phax/phive

This project is divided into sub-projects each keeping tracking of one document type set:
* phive-rules-cii - Validation rules for pure UN CII (without any Schematron)
* phive-rules-cius-pt - Validation rules for the Portuguese EN 16931 CIUS (since v1.0.11)

* phive-rules-peppol-italy - Peppol Italy specific rules (since v2.1.1)
* phive-rules-setu - Dutch SETU selected standards (since v3.0.4)
* phive-rules-simplerinvoicing - Dutch Simplerinvoicing support from https://github.com/Simplerinvoicing/validation
* phive-rules-svefaktura - Validation rules for Swedish Svefaktura (since v1.0.6)

## Peppol Validation Artefact Versioning

If you wonder why the Peppol version differs from the original version numbers - this is because I started versioning the Peppol artefacts before OpenPeppol did.
As OpenPeppol is only changing the "micro" version part (3.0.x), whereas I started using the "minor" part (3.x) from the beginning, I could never take over the official version numbers because their version number would always "smaller" then any old version from my numbering scheme.
I hope that with the introduction of PINT, the versioning problem will be solved.
