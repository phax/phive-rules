The Ordering process includes the sending of Orders from a Buyer to a Seller and the response of the Seller.

[[process-flow]]
== Process flow

The Ordering process flow can be described as follows:

* A Buyer submits an Order to the Seller requesting for delivery of goods or services
* An Order may refer to a framework agreement for its terms and conditions; otherwise the Buyer’s terms and conditions apply.
* An Order may contain items (goods or services) with item identifiers or items with free text description.
* The Seller may acknowledge that the order is received.
* The Seller may accept the Order, committing himself to the conditions stated therein by means of an Order Response transaction.
* Alternatively, the Seller may reject the Order by means of the Order Response transaction.
* An order rejection may contain reasons for rejection.
* If contractually agreed, the Seller also may respond to the order, changing details that are acceptable by the Buyer.
** If an order is accepted with change, the buyer and seller need to have an agreement between them regarding the processing of the changed order,
 i.e when is a contract concluded and when can the items be shipped.
* If the order was accepted a contract is concluded.
If the order was rejected, no contract and no residual obligations exist.
* After the receipt of an Order Response that rejects the order, the Buyer may start a new ordering process, taking into account the reasons for the rejection by the Seller.
