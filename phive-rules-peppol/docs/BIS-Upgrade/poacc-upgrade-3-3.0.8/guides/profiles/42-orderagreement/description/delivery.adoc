Delivery gives information on when and where the goods and services are delivered.

* Delivery location (`cac:Delivery/cac:DeliveryTerms/cac:DeliveryLocation`) is where the supplier leaves the packages.
* Delivery party (`cac:Delivery/cac:DeliveryParty`) is the party who will get the ordered items.

Delivery special terms may be used to inform how the the goods or service is delivered. E.g.

* A ticket may be delivered as a pdf in mail - “Mail”.
* Goods may have been collected at the store – “Customer pick up“

The delivery information is optional in the PEPPOL BIS Order Agreement message.
