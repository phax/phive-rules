= Product identification

Product identification may be done using the identifiers described below:

* Sellers ID
* Standard ID, e.g. the GS1 Global Trade Item Number (GTIN)
* Buyers ID

The order agreement requires that an item has an identifier. This can be either the sellers identifier or a standard identifier. Which identifier to use depends on what is known at the time of the purchase or what is commonly used in the relevant business sector.

The Product name is often sent in the order agreement from the buyer to the seller.
