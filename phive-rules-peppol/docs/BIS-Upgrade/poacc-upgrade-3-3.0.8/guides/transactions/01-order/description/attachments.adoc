= Attachments

Non-XML documents can be sent as attachments to the PEPPOL BIS Order.
This could be drawings or time sheets or other documents relevant for the order.
The attachment can either be sent as a binary object encoded in Base64 embedded in the message or as a URI to an external address as a link.

NOTE: It is recommended to send attachments as embedded, binary objects and not as external references.

Valid codes can be found in {link-codelist}.

<1> It is recommended to use element `cac:AdditionalDocumentReference/cbc:DocumentType` to send a short description of the content of the attachment.
<2> File name and extension should be sent in the filename attribute to the `cbc:EmbeddedDocumentBinaryObject` element.  


IMPORTANT: Attachments should be used for additional information and not as order copies.
